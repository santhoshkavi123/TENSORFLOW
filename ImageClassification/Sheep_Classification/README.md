# Overview
In this folder, we will work with an image dataset of 7 popular sheep breeds deeply rooted in Arabian heritage. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies each image into one of seven distinct local breeds.


# Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of labelled images, and the associated .csv file contains the corresponding labels.

# Files
- train_labels.csv - tabular file containing the file names of the images alongside their correct label

# Columns
- Columns of the file train_label.csv are as follows:

    - filename - the filename of the image

    - label - the label of the correct date type ( Naeimi, Najdi, etc.)
