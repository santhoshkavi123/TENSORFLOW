    "\n",
    "-  As with other NLP Tasks, text summarization requires text first undergo processing, this includes tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming or lemmatization. After pre-processing, all extractive text summarization methods follows three general, independent steps: representation, sentence scoring and sentence selection. \n",

    "- Representation : Mostly, Bag of Words models which represent text segments - such as words or sentences - as datapoints in a vector space. We can also use Word Embeddings here, but previous statements says the mostly commonly used approach.\n",

    "- Sentence Scoring : For Sentence Scoring we can use Topic Modelling tools such as latent sematic analysis (LSA) are another representation method that produce groups of summary keyowrds weighted across documents. "
